Love that you’re thinking beyond the obvious, Twahir 👌. Apart from **voice, barcode, search, grid, quick sale, and object detection**, there are indeed some **futuristic or forgotten UX methods** that could inspire Simamia. Let’s explore:

---

## 🔮 Futuristic / Forgotten Input Methods

### 1. **NFC / Tap‑to‑Identify**
- Cashier taps product with an NFC tag → auto‑added to cart.  
- **Forgotten angle:** NFC tags are cheap but underused in retail.  
- **Best for:** High‑value items (phones, electronics) or reusable packaging.  
- **Challenge:** Requires tagging every product.

---

### 2. **RFID Bulk Scanning**
- Place items near a reader → all scanned at once.  
- **Futuristic:** Feels like magic checkout.  
- **Best for:** Warehouses, supermarkets with tagged stock.  
- **Challenge:** Hardware cost, setup complexity.

---

### 3. **Gesture‑Based UX**
- Cashier swipes or taps physical gestures (like “draw a circle” for quantity).  
- **Forgotten:** Early POS experiments tried this but abandoned due to training overhead.  
- **Best for:** Touch‑heavy kiosks, but less practical in Kariakoo.

---

### 4. **QR Code Menus**
- Instead of scanning product barcodes, each category has a QR code.  
- Cashier scans → instantly loads product list.  
- **Best for:** Restaurants, coffee shops, wholesale categories.  
- **Challenge:** Requires printed QR menus.

---

### 5. **Voice + Tap Hybrid**
- Cashier says *“Sugar two kilos”* → app suggests item.  
- Cashier taps confirm → added to cart.  
- **Futuristic:** Combines speed of voice with accuracy of tap.  
- **Best for:** Busy shops where hands are full.

---

### 6. **Smart Weight Scale Integration**
- Place product on digital scale → app reads weight → auto price.  
- **Forgotten but practical:** Many groceries already use scales.  
- **Best for:** Rice, sugar, flour, produce.  
- **Challenge:** Needs hardware integration.

---

### 7. **Pattern‑Based Shortcuts**
- Cashier enters **short codes** (e.g. “S1” = Sugar 1kg, “M2” = Milk 2L).  
- **Forgotten method:** Old cash registers used PLU codes.  
- **Best for:** Shops with repeat items.  
- **Challenge:** Requires memorization, but very fast once learned.

---

## ⚖️ Practical Verdict
- **Most futuristic:** RFID bulk scanning, smart scales.  
- **Most forgotten but practical:** PLU codes (shortcuts), QR menus.  
- **Most realistic for Kariakoo rollout:** Smart scales + PLU shortcuts (cheap, fast, offline‑friendly).

---

✅ In short: Beyond voice/object detection, you could revive **PLU codes** (fast manual shortcuts) or integrate **smart scales** for groceries. Both are practical, futuristic in feel, and suit Kariakoo realities.

Would you like me to **design a “Smart Scale + PLU Shortcut” page layout in words** so you can see how those methods would look inside Simamia?
