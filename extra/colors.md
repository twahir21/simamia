I’ll be blunt and practical — this is a **POS system**, not a marketing website.
Your color choice must reduce **mistakes, fatigue, and hesitation**, not look fancy.

---

## Short answer (decision)

**Main color: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A)**
**Background: Dark Blue (not white, not pure black)**
**Primary action color: Emerald Green (#10B981)**

Anything else as main = weak choice.

---

## Why Deep Blue must be your main color

### Deep Blue is for:

* App shell (header, frame, panels)
* Stability
* Long working hours

Cashiers stare at this screen **8–12 hours/day**.

❌ White background = eye fatigue
❌ Black background = poor contrast + cheap look
❌ Green background = stressful + “everything looks like success”

Deep blue is calm, professional, and forgiving.

---

## Correct Background Strategy

### DO NOT use:

* Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) → too bright
* Pure black (`#000000`) → harsh contrast

### USE:

* **Deep blue as base**
* Slight gradients or darker/lighter blue layers

Example:

* Page background: `#162B63` (darker blue)
* Panels/cards: `#1E3A8A`
* Inner surfaces: slightly lighter blue-gray

This gives **depth without noise**.

---

## How each color should be used (very important)

### 🟦 Deep Blue (#1E3A8A)

**Role:** Structural color

Use for:

* Header
* App background
* Card containers
* Tabs background

Never use it for:

* Buttons that require action

---

### 🟢 Emerald Green (#10B981)

**Role:** Action & success

Use for:

* Active tab
* Primary buttons (Cash Sale)
* Confirm / Done
* Success states

Rule:

> If everything is green, nothing is important.

---

### ⚪ Warm Gray (#6B7280)

**Role:** Neutral & secondary

Use for:

* Inactive tabs
* Borders
* Labels
* Secondary buttons
* Text that isn’t critical

This color prevents visual chaos.

---

### 🟡 Accent Gold (#F59E0B)

**Role:** Attention & caution

Use for:

* Mobile Money (attention but not danger)
* Hold Sale
* Warnings
* Highlights

⚠️ Strict rule:

* Less than **5–8% of screen**

Gold everywhere = visual screaming.

---

## What about white?

White is still needed — **sparingly**.

Use white for:

* Text on dark backgrounds
* Input fields
* Numbers (totals)
* Cart text

White should **float on blue**, not dominate it.

---

## Recommended Button Color Mapping (POS-safe)

* **Cash Sale** → Emerald Green
* **Mobile Money** → Accent Gold
* **Debt / Credit** → Warm Gray (or muted blue-gray)

Why?

* Cash = success
* Mobile = attention
* Debt = neutral / caution

This trains the brain subconsciously.

---

## Tabs: different backgrounds?

### YES — but only slightly

* Inactive tabs: Warm Gray / muted blue
* Active tab: Emerald Green background
* Icon/text always white

❌ Never change the entire screen background per tab
Cashiers rely on consistency, not decoration.

---

## Final Supervisor Verdict

You’re thinking in the right direction, but don’t turn this into a design experiment.

**Correct hierarchy**

1. Deep Blue → structure
2. Emerald Green → action
3. Warm Gray → calm
4. Gold → alert

If you break this hierarchy, your app will *look nice* and *work badly*.

If you want next:

* Exact hex variants (lighter/darker shades)
* Accessibility contrast rules (important for eyes)
* Theme tokens for React Native / Tailwind
* Dark-mode vs light-mode decision

Say the word.
