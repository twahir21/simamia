This is a really sharp UX question 👌 — because you’re balancing **speed, frequency of use, and context-specific workflows**. Let’s break it down:

---

## ⚡ Core UX Principles for Your Case
- **< 3 taps & < 2s rule** → The entry point must feel *instant*. Every extra gesture adds friction.
- **High frequency (50+ times/day)** → Muscle memory matters more than discoverability. Users should land exactly where they expect.
- **Contextual workflows** → Different shop owners rely on different methods (Scan vs Grid vs Quick Sale). One-size-fits-all tabs will frustrate them.

## 🔑 Options Compared

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best Fit |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Fixed 3 Tabs (no scroll)** | Fast, clean, predictable. Easy to hit in <2s. | Forces you to pick only 3 workflows → risk of excluding key use cases. | Shops with consistent workflows (e.g. supermarkets always scanning). |
| **Scrollable Tabs (4–5+)** | Covers all workflows without hiding features. | Slower: scrolling adds friction, breaks the <2s rule. | Occasional use apps, not high-frequency POS. |
| **Remember Last Used Tab** | Ultra-fast: user lands exactly where they left off. | Risk: if they need a different workflow, switching may take extra taps. | High-frequency apps where one workflow dominates (e.g. 80% scanning). |
| **User-Customizable Tabs** | Tailored experience, shop owners pick their top 3. | Adds complexity (settings screen, onboarding). Needs careful design to avoid confusion. | Diverse businesses (restaurants vs salons vs supermarkets). |

## 🎯 Recommendation for Simamia POS
- **Default: 3 fixed tabs** → Pick the *most universal* workflows (e.g. **Scan, Smart Search, Quick Sale**).
- **Add “Favorites” inside Quick Sale** → Instead of a separate tab, make it a shortcut list within Quick Sale. That keeps the tab bar uncluttered.
- **Remember last used tab** → Optional enhancement. If a shop owner always uses Grid, they’ll land there automatically.
- **Customization (later stage)** → Offer a “Customize Tabs” option in settings. Let shop owners swap which 3 tabs appear. This respects different industries without cluttering the default UX.

## 🚀 Smoothest Flow
1. **First-time setup** → Default 3 tabs (Scan, Smart Search, Quick Sale).  
2. **Daily use** → App remembers last used tab → <2s entry.  
3. **Advanced users** → Settings allow swapping tabs (e.g. replace Smart Search with Grid).  

This way you hit **speed, flexibility, and simplicity** without overwhelming shop owners.

👉 I can sketch out a **tab priority matrix** (which tabs to show by default vs optional) so you can decide which 3 should be fixed and which should be customizable. Would you like me to draft that?
