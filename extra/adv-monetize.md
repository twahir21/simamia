Short answer first, then the business impact.

---

## 1️⃣ If user stays **offline**, do ads still pay?

**No. In almost all cases, ads do NOT pay when offline.**

### Why

* Google AdMob, Meta Audience Network, Unity Ads, etc. **must fetch ads from the internet**
* If the device is offline:

  * No ad request → no impression → **no revenue**
* Cached ads are **rarely payable** (most networks don’t count them)

### What actually happens offline

* Ad slot stays empty **or**
* You show a placeholder (“Connect to internet to support us”)
* **0 TSh earned**

### Real impact in Africa

* Many users stay offline for long periods
* Result: **free users + offline = zero monetization**

This is a **big weakness of ads in African markets**.

## 2️⃣ What if you add **14-day trial** to 500 TSh/day?

This is actually **very strong** if done correctly.

### How users think

* “Let me test first, then I’ll decide”
* Reduces fear of payment
* Builds habit → habit converts

### But there’s a catch ⚠️

If the app works **fully offline** during trial:

* Some users will:

  * Install
  * Use 14 days
  * Never pay
  * Reinstall / clear data

So trial must be **controlled**, not naive.

## 3️⃣ Ads vs 500/day + 14-day trial (REAL comparison)

### Scenario A: Free + Ads

| Situation      | Revenue         |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Online user    | Low–medium      |
| Offline user   | **Zero**        |
| Heavy usage    | Often still low |
| Predictability | ❌ unstable      |

### Scenario B: 500/day + 14-day trial

| Situation      | Revenue                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Online user    | High                                      |
| Offline user   | **Still payable** (if already subscribed) |
| Retention      | Higher                                    |
| Predictability | ✅ stable                                  |

## 4️⃣ The **BEST practical model** (recommended)

### ✅ Hybrid that works in Africa

**1. Free tier**

* Limited features
* Ads shown **only when online**
* Offline: restricted or read-only

**2. Premium (500 TSh/day)**

* 14-day trial
* Works offline
* No ads
* Full features

**3. Trial rules (important)**

* Require:

  * Phone number OR device binding
  * One trial per device
* After 14 days:

  * Offline usage blocked until payment
  * Or switch back to free limited mode

---

## 5️⃣ Strategic conclusion (very important)

> **Ads are weak when users are offline.
> Subscriptions are strong even offline.**

So:

* If your app is **mostly online** → ads make sense
* If your app is **useful offline (POS, learning, tools)** → subscription wins
* 14-day trial **increases conversion**, but must be protected

---

## 6️⃣ My clear recommendation for YOU

👉 **Do NOT rely on ads alone**
👉 **Use 14-day trial + 500/day + longer plans**

Ads should be:

* A **secondary income**
* A **pressure tool** to push users to premium

---

If you want next, I can:

* Design **trial-expired offline lock logic**
* Suggest **exact trial conversion KPIs**
* Help you choose **trial length (7 vs 14 days)** based on African data

Just tell me.
